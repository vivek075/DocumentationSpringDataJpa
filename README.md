# Documentation on SpringDataJpa
This is a documentation to understand Spring Data Jpa.

Spring Data JPA is a part of the larger Spring Data family, which aims to simplify the development of data access layers in Java applications. It builds on top of the Java Persistence API (JPA) and offers a higher-level abstraction for interacting with databases, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing productivity.

**_Core Components of Spring Data JPA_**

1. **Repositories**:

_Repository Interface_: At the core of Spring Data JPA is the repository abstraction. Developers define repository interfaces that extend from one of the predefined Spring Data interfaces, such as `JpaRepository`, `CrudRepository`, or `PagingAndSortingRepository`.

_JpaRepository Interface_: This provides CRUD operations, pagination, and sorting capabilities. It includes methods like `save()`, `findById()`, `findAll()`, `delete()`, etc.

2. **Entity Classes**:

These are Java classes annotated with JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, and so on. They represent the database tables and their relationships.

3. **Repository Methods**:

_Derived Query Methods_: Spring Data JPA can automatically generate query implementations based on the method names in the repository interface. For example, a method named `findByLastName` will be translated into a SQL query that searches for entities with a specific last name.

_Custom Query Methods_: Developers can use the `@Query` annotation to define custom JPQL or native SQL queries directly within the repository interface.

_Query DSL_: Spring Data JPA also supports Query DSL for building type-safe queries programmatically.

**_How Spring Data JPA Works Internally_**

_Bootstrapping_:

When the application context starts, Spring scans the classpath for repository interfaces and entity classes. This process is usually initiated by an annotation like @EnableJpaRepositories.
Spring Data JPA automatically creates proxy instances for repository interfaces using Java's Proxy or CGLIB library.

_Repository Proxy Creation_:

When a repository bean is requested, Spring creates a proxy instance for the interface.
The proxy intercepts calls to the repository methods and routes them to the appropriate implementations.

_Query Execution_:

- Derived Queries: For derived query methods, Spring Data JPA analyzes the method name, splits it into parts, and translates it into a corresponding JPQL query. It uses metadata information from the entity classes to construct these queries.

- Custom Queries: If the repository method is annotated with `@Query`, the proxy uses the provided JPQL or SQL string to execute the query.

- Query DSL: For type-safe queries, Spring Data JPA provides integration with the Querydsl library, allowing developers to construct queries using a fluent API.

_Transaction Management_:

Spring Data JPA integrates seamlessly with Spring's transaction management. Methods in the repository interface are usually transactional by default.
Developers can control transaction boundaries using annotations like `@Transactional`.

_Entity Management_:

Spring Data JPA leverages JPA's `EntityManager` to manage the lifecycle of entities. The EntityManager handles tasks such as persisting entities, managing entity states (e.g., transient, managed, detached), and executing queries.

_Auditing_:

Spring Data JPA supports auditing features such as tracking entity creation and modification timestamps, as well as the user who made the changes. This is achieved through annotations like `@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate`, and `@CreatedBy`.

Spring Data JPA abstracts much of the complexity involved in data access, allowing developers to focus on business logic. By handling boilerplate code for CRUD operations, query generation, and transaction management, it streamlines the process of interacting with databases and ensures consistency and maintainability in Java applications.

In _Spring Data JPA_, the `@Query` annotation is used to define custom `JPQL` (Java Persistence Query Language) or `native SQL` queries directly on repository methods. This is especially useful when the method name query derivation isn't sufficient for your needs.

Here's an example of how to use the `@Query` annotation in a Spring Data JPA repository and a brief explanation of its internal working:

````
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String department;

    // Getters and setters
}
````
We want to create a repository that can find employees by their department using a custom JPQL query.

````
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    // Custom JPQL query
    @Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department")
    List<Employee> findEmployeesByDepartment(@Param("department") String department);

    // Native SQL query
    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department", nativeQuery = true)
    List<Employee> findEmployeesByDepartmentNative(@Param("department") String department);
}
````

**_How It Works Internally_**

_Annotation Parsing_: When Spring Data JPA initializes the EmployeeRepository bean, it scans for repository interfaces and detects methods annotated with @Query.

_Query Translation_:

  JPQL Query: If the `@Query` annotation contains a JPQL statement, Spring Data JPA uses the EntityManager to create a TypedQuery based on the provided JPQL.
  
  Native SQL Query: If the `@Query` annotation has nativeQuery set to true, Spring Data JPA uses the EntityManager to create a NativeQuery.

_Parameter Binding_: The parameters provided to the method are bound to the query placeholders. The `@Param` annotation is used to map method parameters to named parameters in the query.

_Query Execution_: The query is executed, and the result is returned. The result is automatically mapped to the domain model (in this case, the `Employee` entity).

**_Internals of Query Execution_**

Spring Data JPA leverages the underlying JPA provider (like Hibernate) to handle the actual query execution. The high-level flow looks like this:

_Query Preparation_:

The repository infrastructure creates a QueryMethod instance for each method annotated with `@Query`.
This instance encapsulates the metadata about the query, such as the JPQL/SQL string, method parameters, and return type.

_Query Creation_:

For JPQL, a `Query` object is created via `EntityManager.createQuery()`.

For native SQL, a `NativeQuery` object is created via `EntityManager.createNativeQuery()`.

_Parameter Binding_:

The parameters are bound to the query using the names provided in the @Param annotations or positionally if no @Param annotations are used.

_Execution and Result Mapping_:

The query is executed, and the results are fetched.

The JPA provider (like Hibernate) maps the result set to the entity or DTO (Data Transfer Object) specified by the method's return type.
